    <h1>Project Brief</h1>
    <h1>Topic Summary</h1>
    <p>Instgrat is a spoof of the app Instagram. The name is intended to be short for “instant gratification”. The instant gratification is a name based on the attention that social media gives users from online interaction and validation. An alternate name could be "Inztagarn", to look like the word "Instagram", but the pronounciation is more awkward.</p>

    <h1>Target Audience</h1>
    <p>Ideally the user is already familiar with social media—Instagram, specifically. This means that the target audience is most likely Gen Z, but may also include any currently social media-active millennial. Besides knowing how to navigate the
      photo-sharing app, the target audience is also an active user who may be addicted to the social media influencer culture.</p>

    <h1>Goals of the Project </h1>
    <p>(and how it will work)</p>
    <p>The goal of the project is to make the audience reflect on their social media or Instagram usage habits. This will be done primarily through their profile page, their feed, and secondarily through their activity page and search page. The feed
      posts will not feature posts by other people—instead, it will be a live camera feed, getting more and more distorted as the user scrolls down. This represents the user’s self-image being more and more negatively influenced over constant social
      media usage. The profile will also have a live feed with filters altering each of the post tiles, but will not be negatively distorted. This will represent the user’s ego. The page for likes will show usernames that the audience may not
      consider, with the word “like” replaced with “validate” to represent the user’s want to acquire online interaction in order to feel valid.</p>

    <h1>Goals for the Overall Look and Feel </h1>
    <p>(visual strategies, such as formal details including color and type)</p>
    <p>The overall look and feel will be similar to that of Instagram’s, except with clear distinctions that make it different from the app in order to avoid copyright issues. The look will be clean with a lot of white space. The feel of the app will be clean, but may perhaps be "glitchy" in the text or the feel. </p>
