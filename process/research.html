    <h1>Research</h1>
    <p>In search of more information on reducing device usage, I read through a few articles that suggested different ways of tackling the problem of digital addiction. From earlier research I myself define the problem as one primarily for my eyes, which continue to decline in health, for my productivity, which I’ve also noticed to decline due to social media (namely that to Instagram, but including Twitter and Facebook as well) and for my self-esteem, which I’ve developed a correlation to my productivity and creative drive. Despite the increasing trend of digitizing content these days for the purpose of sharing and accessibilty, I find myself wanting to be on my devices less and less, to reverse the correlated negative effects with screen usage.</p>

<p>Such action has already been taken through the invention of ingenious apps such as Mute and Stretchly. I previously gave a review on the Mute mobile app expressing my disappointment in the app’s requirement of payment, but upon further inspection, I realized I was wrong--the app itself can function regularly, without the need of a premium subscription. Evidently, this was completely optional. Mute has been working efficiently by sending me push notifications that induce guilt--telling me how many hours I’ve been on my phone, and how many times in a day I’ve stopped to pick it up and open it. It has been an effective app that I fully recommend. </p>

<p>Stretchly, on the other hand, (lifehacker)</p>

<p>At the end of the New York Times article “The 7-Day Digital Diet” by Teddy Wayne, he suggests that perhaps the real issue for most of us isn’t our phones and computers, but an older and less mobile device. I truly wouldn’t be as addicted to my phone should I have my old childhood brick of a Nokia 3310 phone, and even less so for my earliest high school phone, a red flip phone I still used through 2013. And so the question must be: if it isn’t without social media, might it be the screen itself?</p>

<p>In “Why it’s high time you ditched that digital detox nonsense”, writer Carlo Rotti agrees, offering the solution of changing the way we interact with screens. Citing the researchers of RMTI University in Melbourne, Rotti talks about the nano hologram that replaces the screen. Their goal, while “making screen size irrelevant,” is to integrate the usage of technology in a less threatening way. </p>
